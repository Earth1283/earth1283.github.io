# Github Sites
What can possibly go wrong?
## Why?
Just for github sites for MineHorizon and eterma
For what reason I do not know but still 
-.-
Moral obligation to do this.

## Your main page...
Yes, I know.
I will work on it later.

# Scaling and updating
Below is a tutorial on how to scale the news article updates (even though nobody else will do it except me)
apply these to `news.html`
The webpage will auto-scale
```html
<div class="card">
    <div class="card-date">date here</div>
    <h2 class="card-title">insert title</h2>
    <div class="card-content">
        CONTENT HERE
        multiline suport!
    </div>
</div>
```
The reset CSS will handle.
